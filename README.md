# What's this?

Shortly - it's a collection (or it will be a collection in the future) of various JavaScript utils, plugins, libraries. Some of them can be the real masterpieces, some of them can be just result of boredom. I treat this creature as a playground where I can develop the programming skills in less formal way.
